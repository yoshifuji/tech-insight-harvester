# Welcome to Tech Insight Harvester

Welcome to our automated technology intelligence platform! This blog will feature updates about the platform, insights from our AI-powered content curation, and announcements about new features.

## What is Tech Insight Harvester?

Tech Insight Harvester is an automated pipeline that:

- 🔍 **Discovers** the latest technology articles using Google Custom Search
- 📖 **Extracts** clean, readable content from web sources
- 🧠 **Processes** articles with GPT-4o for optimization and categorization
- 📝 **Generates** structured documentation automatically
- 🚀 **Publishes** content via Docusaurus and GitHub Pages
- 🔎 **Indexes** everything with vector embeddings for semantic search

## How It Works

The entire pipeline is triggered by simply editing a `keywords.yaml` file. Add new keywords, commit the changes, and our GitHub Actions workflows automatically:

1. Crawl for new articles
2. Extract and clean content
3. Process with AI for SEO optimization
4. Generate Markdown documentation
5. Build and deploy the site
6. Create vector embeddings for search
