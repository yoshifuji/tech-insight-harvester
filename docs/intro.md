# Tech Insights

Welcome to our automatically curated collection of technology articles and insights.

This platform uses an AI-powered pipeline to:

- 🔍 **Discover** the latest technology articles based on curated keywords
- 📖 **Extract** clean, readable content from web sources
- 🧠 **Process** articles with GPT-4o for SEO optimization and categorization
- 📝 **Generate** structured Markdown documentation
- 🚀 **Publish** automatically via Docusaurus and GitHub Pages
- 🔎 **Index** content with vector embeddings for semantic search

## How It Works

### 1. Keyword-Driven Discovery
Our crawler uses Google Custom Search API to find fresh articles based on keywords defined in `keywords.yaml`. Simply add new keywords to automatically expand coverage.

### 2. Intelligent Content Processing
Each discovered article is processed through our LLM pipeline:
- **Content Extraction**: Clean text extraction from web pages
- **SEO Optimization**: AI-generated titles and summaries
- **Smart Categorization**: Automatic tagging based on content analysis
- **Structured Data**: JSON-LD metadata for better discoverability

### 3. Automated Publishing
New content is automatically:
- Converted to Docusaurus-compatible Markdown
- Committed via GitHub Actions
- Built and deployed to GitHub Pages
- Indexed in our vector database for search

## Getting Started

To add new topics of interest:

1. Edit `keywords.yaml` in the repository
2. Add your keywords to the list
3. Commit and push - the pipeline will automatically start discovering content

## Search

Use our semantic search to find relevant articles by meaning, not just keywords. The search understands context and can find related content even if it doesn't contain your exact search terms.
